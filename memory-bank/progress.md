# Progress Tracking - AudioScripts Project

## What's Working âœ…

### Phase 1: Performance-Based Content Selection (COMPLETE)
- **Social Media Integration**: TikTok and Instagram content extraction via RapidAPI
- **Performance-Based Selection**: View count extraction and sorting for top performers
- **Smart Collection Strategy**: Collects 2x requested videos, sorts by performance, selects top N
- **Default Configuration**: System defaults to 40 videos for optimal fine-tuning datasets
- **API Integration**: Robust error handling, rate limiting, and comprehensive logging
- **User Interface**: Clean React components with real-time status updates
- **Performance Display**: View count and like count with emoji indicators
- **Google Drive Integration**: Automatic folder creation with timestamps
- **Performance Metadata**: Complete JSON files with view counts, like counts, and sorting data
- **Video Quality Tracking**: Preserves bitrate/resolution information
- **Content Filtering**: Only processes actual video content (not images)
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple API calls to collect large pools for sorting

### Phase 2: Transcription Infrastructure (COMPLETE)
- **Complete Gemini Integration**: Full transcription system with marketing analysis
- **Marketing Segment Extraction**: Hook, Bridge, Golden Nugget, WTA analysis
- **Word-Level Analysis**: Every word categorized into marketing segments with position tracking
- **Processing Modes**: Fast mode (3-6s), Standard mode (8-12s), Marketing Analysis (35-40s)
- **Video Download System**: Handles video file downloading with size/timeout validation
- **Gemini Client**: API interactions with rate limiting, error handling, and parallel processing
- **TranscriptionService**: Complete orchestration of download â†’ analysis â†’ storage pipeline
- **Validation System**: Ensures word assignments match original transcript
- **Google Drive Storage**: Structured folder organization with comprehensive metadata
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/transcribe-videos` with health checks and detailed responses
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error isolation and detailed logging
- **Batch Processing**: Sequential and parallel processing options based on batch size

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Environment Validation**: Checks for required API keys and configuration
- **Input Sanitization**: Username validation and cleanup
- **Performance Logging**: Comprehensive logging including view count verification
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation throughout
- **Smart Collection**: Collects 2x requested amount for better performance-based selection
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent delays and request management across all APIs
- **Memory Management**: Efficient video buffer handling and cleanup

## What's Left to Build ðŸš§

### Phase 2: Workflow Integration & Optimization (CURRENT FOCUS)
Since transcription infrastructure is complete, remaining work focuses on:

- **Seamless Workflow**: Connect video extraction directly to transcription pipeline
- **40-Video Optimization**: Test and optimize processing for new batch size (vs previous 100)
- **End-to-End Testing**: Validate complete workflow from extraction â†’ transcription â†’ storage
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track processing times for 40-video batches (~25-30 minutes expected)
- **User Experience**: Streamline the complete workflow for top 40 performers

### Phase 3: Training Data Export (NEXT MAJOR PHASE)
- **JSONL Export System**: Convert transcriptions to Gemini fine-tuning format
- **Training Data Structure**: `{"input": "Write a script about [topic]", "output": "[transcription]"}`
- **Performance Metadata Integration**: Include view counts and engagement metrics in training data
- **Batch Export Functionality**: Export complete 40-video datasets for fine-tuning
- **Quality Validation**: Ensure training data format meets Gemini fine-tuning requirements
- **Download Interface**: User-friendly download of prepared training datasets

### Phase 4: Gemini Fine-Tuning Integration (FUTURE)
- **Google AI Studio API**: Direct integration with Gemini fine-tuning endpoints
- **Training Job Management**: Start, monitor, and manage fine-tuning jobs
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy and test fine-tuned models
- **Performance Metrics**: Track training progress and model performance
- **User Model Management**: Handle multiple user models and versions

## Current Status Summary

### Completed Infrastructure
- âœ… **Content Extraction**: Performance-based video selection (40 top performers)
- âœ… **Transcription System**: Complete Gemini-based analysis with marketing segments
- âœ… **Word-Level Analysis**: Comprehensive categorization and validation
- âœ… **Storage System**: Google Drive integration with structured organization
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Robust error management and user feedback
- âœ… **API Infrastructure**: All endpoints working with comprehensive logging

### Ready for Integration
The system has all core components built and tested:
- Video extraction identifies top 40 performing videos
- Transcription system can process all 40 videos with marketing analysis
- Storage system organizes results with comprehensive metadata
- UI provides real-time feedback throughout the process

### Next Implementation Steps
1. **Connect Workflows**: Link extraction â†’ transcription in single user flow
2. **Optimize for 40 Videos**: Test complete pipeline with new batch size
3. **Build JSONL Export**: Prepare training data for Gemini fine-tuning
4. **User Testing**: Validate end-to-end experience with real creators

The project is well-positioned with comprehensive infrastructure already built. The focus shifts from building core functionality to optimizing workflows and preparing training data export capabilities.
